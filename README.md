### Project Description :
This Online Train Reservation System is designed to facilitate easy and efficient booking and management of train reservations. The system includes essential features such as a Login Form for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the system, and a Reservation Form where users can enter required details like passenger information, train number, journey date, and destinations. The train name will be auto-populated, streamlining the booking process. Additionally, the Cancellation Form allows users to retrieve booking information using a PNR number and confirm ticket cancellations, simplifying the process for passengers. All data is stored in a central database, accessible to authorized personnel, improving data accessibility and reducing manual efforts for customers and staff.

### Project Description :
The "Guess the Number" project is a fun and interactive Java program that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number. The system picks a number within a specified range, typically from 1 to 100, and the user is asked to input their guesses. After each guess, the program informs the user whether their guess is correct, or if the guessed number is higher or lower than the system's number. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

Additional features can be incorporated to make the game more engaging:
<li>Limiting the number of attempts to increase difficulty.</li>
<li>Adding multiple rounds to extend gameplay.</li>
<li>Displaying the score after each round.</li>
<li>Awarding points based on how quickly the user guesses the correct number. The fewer attempts, the higher the score!</li>
